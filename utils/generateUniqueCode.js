// This code exports a function called `generateCode` from a module. The purpose of this function is to generate a one-time password (OTP) using the `otp-generator` library. Let's break down the code:

// ```javascript
// import otpGenerator from "otp-generator";
// ```

// This line imports the `otp-generator` library, which is presumably a library designed for generating OTPs.

// ```javascript
// export const generateCode = (num) => {
// ```

// This line exports a function named `generateCode`. The function takes one parameter, `num`, which represents the length of the OTP to be generated.

// ```javascript
//   const code = otpGenerator.generate(num, {
//     upperCaseAlphabets: true,
//     specialChars: false,
//   });
// ```

// Within the function, it uses the `otpGenerator.generate` method from the imported library to generate an OTP. The `generate` method takes two arguments:

// - `num`: The length of the OTP, which is passed as an argument to the `generateCode` function.
// - An options object:
//   - `upperCaseAlphabets`: A boolean indicating whether to include uppercase letters in the OTP. In this case, it's set to `true`, so uppercase letters are included.
//   - `specialChars`: A boolean indicating whether to include special characters in the OTP. In this case, it's set to `false`, so special characters are not included.

// The generated OTP is stored in the `code` variable.

// ```javascript
//   return `#${code}`;
// ```

// Finally, the function returns a string that concatenates a "#" symbol with the generated OTP. This is a specific formatting choice, and the "#" symbol may be used to distinguish OTPs generated by this function.

// In summary, this module exports a function `generateCode` that uses the `otp-generator` library to generate a one-time password with specific characteristics (length, inclusion of uppercase letters, exclusion of special characters) and returns the OTP with a "#" symbol prefixed to it.
